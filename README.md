***

**ACE TFAR Long Range Radio Setter** is a simple Quality of Life mod for the ARMA 3 written by [Chatter](https://github.com/RTO-Chatter) and [M3ales](https://github.com/M3ales) which allows you to save/load your [TFAR Long Range Radio](https://github.com/michail-nikolaev/task-force-arma-3-radio) configuration via an [ACE Self Interaction](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3).

The mod stores data locally in `profileNamespace` which means it stores configurations on a per profile basis. This has the added side effect of requiring you to save a new configuration for each profile you make use of, but also ensures you can have different LR configurations for different units etc.

## Requirements

- [ACE 3](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3)
- [Task Force Radio 0.9.7 +](https://github.com/michail-nikolaev/task-force-arma-3-radio)

## Notes

- TFAR is required, but it is version independent as far as my own testing has gone. If you use a version other than the one listed, or if you use a local version, this should still work. Currently written and tested under 0.9.7.
