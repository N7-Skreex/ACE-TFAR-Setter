# CHTR_TFAR_QoL
A Simple Quality of Life mod for the ARMA 3 TFAR Addon by M3ales and Myself.

Allows you to save your current Long Range configuration, and reload it at any point in the future until a new config is saved.

Changing ARMA 3 profiles will mean you no longer have access to the settings and will have to resave a new setup. Switching back to the original profile will have the setup last saved on the profile.

TFAR is required, but it is version independent as far as my own testing has gone. If you use a version other than the one listed, or if you use a local version, this should still work.
